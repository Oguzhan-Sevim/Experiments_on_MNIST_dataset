This assignment is prepared for EE 689 Deep Learning Neural Networks course offered in Bogazici University, Istanbul.

Different neural network structures are experimented for modeling the MNIST dataset which consists of hand-written digits with class labels.

From simplest to relatively more complex structures (with at least one convolutional layer), different network structures are experimented.

Implementations are done by using Sequential class of Keras.
